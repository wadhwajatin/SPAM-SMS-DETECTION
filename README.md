# SPAM-SMS-DETECTION

SMS Spam Detection with Gradio
This project demonstrates an SMS spam detection system using machine learning, with an interactive user interface provided by Gradio.

Introduction
The rapid growth of mobile communication has led to an increase in the number of unsolicited spam messages. These messages can be not only annoying but also potentially harmful, containing phishing links or fraudulent information. To combat this issue, this project aims to build a robust machine learning model capable of classifying SMS messages as spam or not spam.

Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, we preprocess and analyze a dataset of SMS messages. We then train a logistic regression model to predict whether a given SMS message is spam. Additionally, we provide an easy-to-use web interface using Gradio, allowing users to input SMS text and instantly receive a spam classification.

Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation.
gradio: For creating the web interface.

Usage
Follow these steps to use the project:

Clone this repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SMS_SPAM_DETECTION_GRADIO.git
cd SMS_SPAM_DETECTION_GRADIO
Open the notebook:
Open the SMS_SPAM_DETECTION_GRADIO.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

Run the notebook:
Execute all cells in the notebook to load the data, train the model, and launch the Gradio interface.

Interact with the interface:
Use the Gradio web interface to input SMS text and get a spam classification. The interface will be accessible via a link generated at the end of the notebook execution.

Project Structure
SMS_SPAM_DETECTION_GRADIO.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing code for data preprocessing, model training, and the Gradio interface.
model.pkl: The saved logistic regression model (generated by the notebook).
vectorizer.pkl: The saved TF-IDF vectorizer (generated by the notebook).
Model Training
The model training process includes the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the SMS dataset by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting text to lowercase.
Feature Extraction: Transforming text data into numerical features using a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer.
Model Training: Training a logistic regression model on the transformed text data to classify messages as spam or not spam.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Saving the Model: Saving the trained model and vectorizer to disk for later use.
Gradio Interface
The Gradio interface allows users to input SMS text and get a real-time classification of whether the message is spam. The interface is created using the following Gradio code:

python
Copy code
import gradio as gr

def classify_sms(text):
    text_tfidf = vectorizer.transform([text])
    prediction = model.predict(text_tfidf)
    return "Spam" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Not Spam"

iface = gr.Interface(
    fn=classify_sms,
    inputs=gr.Textbox(lines=2, placeholder="Enter SMS text here..."),
    outputs=gr.Textbox(),
    title="SMS Spam Detection",
    description="Enter an SMS message to classify it as Spam or Not Spam."
)

iface.launch()
This interface simplifies user interaction, making it accessible to individuals with no coding experience.
